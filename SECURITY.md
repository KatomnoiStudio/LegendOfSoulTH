# Security Policy

Legend of Soul-TH is a small hobby game (React + Vite, deployed to GitHub Pages) with a real
backend: **Supabase (Auth + Postgres + Row Level Security)**, live since 2026-08-07. All account,
currency, character, Star/Shard, admin-status, and World Chat data lives server-side, RLS-protected;
the client never mutates valuable state directly. Read
[`src/data/accountRepository.supabase.ts`](src/data/accountRepository.supabase.ts)
and [`supabase/migrations/`](supabase/migrations/) for exactly what's enforced where before filing
a report. The older client-only `accountRepository.ts`/`password.ts` (localStorage + local PBKDF2)
is **dormant, kept only for the shared validators it re-exports** — `useAuth.ts` no longer imports
its own login/register/session logic, and as of 2026-08-10 **no production module imports it at
all**; the local PBKDF2 path is out of the shipped bundle entirely. Its save-export builds an
allow-listed object (`uid`, `email`, `createdAt`, `player`, `transactions`) rather than deleting
fields from a copy, so `passwordHash`/`passwordSalt` cannot leave the machine and a future
sensitive field cannot leak by default. Still-real limitations are documented in **Out of Scope**
below.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

This project follows a coordinated (responsible) disclosure policy: report a suspected
vulnerability privately first, give the maintainer a reasonable window to investigate and ship a
fix before any public disclosure, and avoid actions that could harm real players (their accounts,
currency, or data) while testing.

Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting — it goes straight to the maintainer, not a public issue:

- [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/KatomnoiStudio/LegendOfSoulTH/security/advisories/new)

**Do not** open a public GitHub issue for a security report.

Include:

- affected file/commit and the URL or build you tested (production `https://katomnoistudio.github.io/LegendOfSoulTH/` vs. a local dev build)
- steps to reproduce from a clean browser profile
- what trust boundary is actually crossed (see Scope below — RLS policies and RPC functions are the real ones now, not "does the client trust itself")
- any logs/screenshots with tokens, emails, or other real data redacted

Expected response:

- **Acknowledgment:** within 7 days (solo-maintained project, best-effort)
- **Fix or mitigation:** no fixed SLA — triaged by actual impact once acknowledged

## Scope

In scope:

- the `KatomnoiStudio/LegendOfSoulTH` repository and its GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/`)
- the deployed site at `https://katomnoistudio.github.io/LegendOfSoulTH/`
- anything that lets one player's browser affect **another** player's account/data, or that
  exfiltrates data the app didn't already hand to the page itself (real XSS, real CSRF-equivalent,
  supply-chain compromise of a dependency actually shipped in the built bundle)
- any way to bypass a Supabase Row Level Security policy or trigger a `SECURITY DEFINER` RPC
  function (`supabase/migrations/*.sql`) into doing something its own checks should have rejected
  (self-granting currency/characters/admin status, reading another player's row, etc.)
- World Chat identity/authority bypasses: posting as another profile, forging the server timestamp,
  bypassing the 10-message/minute throttle, or writing directly to `world_chat_messages`
- friend-list writes reaching **another** player's row. As of 2026-08-10 the client performs
  INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE against `public.friends`, a table it previously only read, to keep the
  synced-snapshot read model in step. RLS caps it to `auth.uid() = profile_id`, so the blast
  radius of the snapshot's unvalidated `friend_uid`/`name`/`level`/`title` values is the
  reporter's own list and is cosmetic by design (`src/types/player.ts`). In scope: any way to
  write a row whose `profile_id` is not your own, or to make one player's snapshot alter what
  another player sees
- Star Ascension authority bypasses: inserting an owned Hero directly, writing `star`/`shards`,
  reusing an idempotency request for another Hero, or bypassing the 1/2/4/8/12 shard ladder
- Gacha authority bypasses: controlling a roll from the client, changing a banner/cost after a
  request ID is committed, spending Gem twice on retry, bypassing pity, or directly writing
  `gacha_pity`, pull history, owned Heroes, or duplicate shards
- Private PvP authority bypasses: joining a room without being one of its two participants,
  sending input as the other player, publishing a forged authoritative snapshot/result, reading
  another room's private Realtime topic, reviving a participant after reconnect grace, replaying an
  older state version, or bypassing the compare-and-swap state version
- account enumeration through the auth surfaces: any way to get a materially different answer for
  an email address that **has** an account than for one that does not, without knowing its password.
  The login path is deliberately non-leaking and pinned by tests (see Auth Abuse Protection below).
  Two known exceptions are already on the record and do **not** need a new report: `register()`
  answers a taken address with 'อีเมลนี้ถูกใช้สมัครไปแล้ว', and no email-based recovery route is
  shipped at all — both are described below
- session-token exposure: anything that puts a user's `access_token`/`refresh_token` somewhere it
  outlives the tab — a URL the browser records in history, a log, an error report, a referrer. Auth
  uses the PKCE flow (`flowType: 'pkce'`, `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts`) specifically so the callback
  carries a one-time `?code=` instead of a JWT fragment; a change that reverts to the implicit flow,
  or an OAuth `redirectTo` that does not land on the app itself, reopens this and is in scope

## Out of Scope

By design, not bugs — don't file these:

- **"I can see/edit values in my own browser's React state or a stale localStorage cache."**
  Expected and low-risk: the server (Supabase, RLS-enforced) is the real source of truth for
  currency/characters/admin-status; any client-side tampering is cosmetic and gets overwritten
  on the next server round-trip. **Do** file a report if you find a way to make a _write_ (an
  RPC call, a direct table mutation) actually persist a value the server should have rejected —
  that crosses a real trust boundary. (This project already fixed real cases of this shape:
  `grant_character` didn't check admin status before 2026-08-07 — see `supabase/migrations/0004_admin_accounts.sql`'s
  own comment for what that looked like and how it was closed. On 2026-08-08, `earn_gold`/`grant_item`
  accepted unbounded client-supplied amounts and `profiles.gold`/`gem` had no column-write protection
  beyond RLS (which is row-scoped, not column-scoped) — see `supabase/migrations/0009_economy_integrity_fixes.sql`.
  Lobby battle rewards use refId-guarded RPCs and a durable pending snapshot table — see
  `supabase/migrations/0013_reward_idempotency.sql`. Star Ascension uses an authenticated,
  atomic, idempotent RPC and a private-write audit ledger — see
  `supabase/migrations/20260808204905_p9_star_ascension_server_authority.sql`. On 2026-08-10,
  `team_slots` accepted any `character_id`, letting a client field a Hero it never owned — RLS
  governs which rows are writable, never which values go in them; closed by a validating trigger
  in `supabase/migrations/20260810101000_security_team_slots_ownership.sql`. Also on 2026-08-10,
  `earn_gold` accepted `p_source = 'topup'` from any authenticated session, letting a client mint
  gold that the ledger then recorded as a paid top-up with no payment verification anywhere in the
  path, and the signup grant was written straight to `profiles` with no matching ledger row —
  closed by `supabase/migrations/20260810100000_security_earn_gold_topup_and_signup_ledger.sql`.
  On 2026-08-10, `profiles`/`owned_characters` `level`/`exp`/`exp_to_next` were client-writable both
  directly (via `savePlayer`) and through `commit_lobby_battle_progression`, which any authenticated
  session could call with arbitrary values, a replayable client-supplied idempotency guard, and an
  arbitrary lead `character_id` the RPC would mint at any level — closed by
  `supabase/migrations/20260810130000_security_harden_lobby_progression_rpc.sql` (column lock +
  server-owned idempotency ledger + rate limit + ownership check + per-call level bounds + EXECUTE
  lock). Also on 2026-08-10, `grant_item` validated nothing about the item id it was handed, so any
  authenticated session could mint an item that does not exist in the game or one held back for an
  unreleased release — closed by a `public.item_catalog` existence check, an RLS-locked catalog table
  no client role can read or write, and the removal of a duplicate 3-argument `grant_item` overload
  whose collision reappeared on every fresh environment because the production fix had only ever been
  hand-applied, in `supabase/migrations/20260810160000_security_audit_hardening_wave1.sql`. The same
  migration revokes EXECUTE from `public`/`anon`/`authenticated` on the maintenance RPCs that had
  shipped without it — including two account-deletion jobs an unauthenticated caller could otherwise
  invoke. Also on 2026-08-10, a hero upgrade's _effect_ persisted while its _cost_ evaporated:
  `savePlayer` could write `skill_levels`/`talent_state`/`awakening_state` but not `profiles.gold`
  (column-locked since `0009`), so the client's gold debit was dropped on save — free, unlimited
  upgrades. `commit_lobby_battle_progression` handed the same three columns out a second way, as
  unvalidated `SECURITY DEFINER` parameters no client-side revoke could reach. Closed by
  `supabase/migrations/20260810180000_p26_progression_cost_authority.sql`: an RLS-locked
  `progression_cost_catalog` the server prices from (the client never sends a price), a
  `spend_progression_upgrade` RPC that debits and applies in one transaction with a compare-and-swap
  on true server state as the replay guard, `revoke update on public.owned_characters from
authenticated` with no re-grant, and the removal of the three progression parameters from
  `commit_lobby_battle_progression`'s signature. **That migration is applied and verified live**:
  the cost catalog seeded 21 rows, `spend_progression_upgrade` exists with `EXECUTE` granted to
  `authenticated` and denied to `anon`, `owned_characters` UPDATE is revoked from `authenticated`,
  and `commit_lobby_battle_progression` is down to a single 18-argument function. An end-to-end
  purchase was driven against production through the real anon-key path: gold went 581 → 541
  with one ledger row, retrying the same request id charged nothing, replaying under a fresh
  request id was refused by the compare-and-swap, and a talent purchase without its prerequisite
  was refused. One residue, re-measured 2026-08-11: that revoke names `authenticated` only, so
  `anon` still holds a table-level UPDATE grant on `owned_characters`. RLS is what closes it — the
  UPDATE policy requires `auth.uid() = profile_id`, unsatisfiable without a session — so this is
  defence-in-depth debt, not a reachable write. Report the same _class_ of bug elsewhere.)
- **"I changed Star/Shard values in React state or called the preview calculator."** The preview
  is presentation-only. Report it only if the change persists in Supabase without a valid
  `ascend_character_star` transaction.
- **"I changed the displayed Gacha result, pity, or Gem balance in React state."** The display is
  not authoritative. Report it only if a roll persists without `perform_gacha_pull`, if retrying
  the same request debits twice, or if a direct table write succeeds.
- **"I can locally hide/show a World Chat author by editing my block list."** `/block` is a
  client-local viewing preference by design. Chat rows themselves remain server-authoritative.
- **"I changed my local PvP position/HP or predicted a different result."** **PvP is not
  deployed — ranked rooms are gated off in the shipped client** (`PVP_BACKEND_DEPLOYED = false`
  in `src/game/featureFlags.ts`, and the `pvp-authority` Edge Function has never been deployed;
  `list_edge_functions` returned empty on 2026-08-13). There is no live PvP surface to attack
  today, and a report scoped against one is scoped against something that does not exist.
  _Corrected 2026-08-16 — this paragraph described the design below in the present tense, which
  read as a live server authority._
  The design, for when it does ship: PvP prediction is presentation-only; the JWT-protected
  `pvp-authority` Edge Function injects the authenticated player identity, advances fixed-tick
  combat, and is the only caller allowed to commit state or results. Postgres broadcasts those committed snapshots to a participant-only private Realtime
  topic; authenticated clients have receive permission but no Broadcast INSERT policy. It reads
  hosted Supabase keys from the platform's plural JSON key sets (`SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEYS` and
  `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEYS`) with legacy project-secret fallbacks; no secret enters the browser bundle.
  A heartbeat timeout and monotonic snapshot version gate make reconnect/prediction disposable.
  Completed results live in a detached audit table while expired unfinished rooms are reaped.
  Report a change only if it persists as authority state or becomes visible in a room you do not
  belong to.
- **Matchmaking, Rank/MMR, PvP rewards, and public PvP lobbies.** These are intentionally excluded
  from P12 and therefore do not yet define a production trust boundary.
- **"Passwords are hashed client-side with no real server auth."** No longer applies to the live
  app — auth is Supabase Auth (server-side), not the old local PBKDF2 layer in
  [`src/lib/password.ts`](src/lib/password.ts) (dormant, kept only as a shared validator source).
- **"CurrencyShopModal payments (gold or gems) aren't real / always succeed."** Still intentional —
  no payment gateway is wired up yet (see `accountRepository.supabase.ts` `topUpGold`/`topUpGems`).
  Not a payment-bypass vulnerability; there is no real payment to bypass. The ledger no longer
  accepts a client-asserted one either — `earn_gold` rejects `p_source = 'topup'` as of
  `20260810100000_security_earn_gold_topup_and_signup_ledger.sql`, so a `topup` row can only ever
  be written by a future gateway-verifying RPC. **Do** report it if you find a way to write one
  without such a gateway.
- Vulnerabilities in a dependency that this project doesn't actually reach at runtime
  (see `npm audit` in CI first — if it's already flagged/tracked there, no need to duplicate).
- **"The error banner shows me an internal error message."** By design as of 2026-08-10 — the
  banner renders `code — message — hint` and marks it copyable precisely so a player can paste it
  into a bug report. Errors are reported to a console-only sink; nothing is transmitted off the
  device. **Do** report it if you find a shipped error path whose message embeds a token, key, or
  another player's data: the scrub redacts email addresses and known-sensitive object _keys_, not
  token-shaped text inside a free-form message string, so a library that puts a bearer token in
  `event.reason.message` would surface it on the one screen that invites copying.

## Auth Abuse Protection

- **Anonymous (guest) sign-in rate limit**: Supabase's `rate_limit_anonymous_users` config,
  confirmed at its default 30/hour (per project, not per-IP) — no code change needed, already
  active. A stale-guest cleanup job bounds how much guest-account farming can accumulate —
  but read the next two sentences before relying on it. Its criterion is now **inactivity**,
  not account age: `supabase/migrations/20260810160000_security_audit_hardening_wave1.sql`
  replaced `0006_guest_cleanup.sql`'s `created_at`-only predicate, which deleted guests who
  played every day (a real bug, caught by audit before it ever fired). The job was re-armed
  after that fix, then **deliberately unscheduled again on 2026-08-11** — this time not for a
  predicate bug but because a CoalBoard review projected its blast radius forward and found it
  would delete 21 of the 24 current guest accounts by 2026-09-08 and all 24 by 09-09, while only
  1 of the 24 has ever recorded a battle. Verified against production: `cleanup-stale-guest-accounts`
  is absent from `cron.job`. The anti-farming bound is therefore a property of the rate limit
  alone until the job is re-armed.
- **Account-deletion jobs, prod-vs-repo drift (RESOLVED 2026-08-10)**: production was running
  `0014_dead_account_cleanup.sql`'s **first revision** — deleting registered accounts by account
  age, guarded only by "never fought a battle". The three follow-up commits that added
  `cleanup_exempt_profiles` and the paid-user guard were written four minutes later and never
  relayed, so the repo held the intent and production held the stale body.
  `supabase/migrations/20260810170000_security_reconcile_dead_account_cleanup.sql` reconciles
  them: the criterion is now **inactivity**, not age — `last_sign_in_at`, recent
  `battle_history`, recent `currency_transactions` excluding source `signup` (the 2026-08-10
  backfill stamped one onto every pre-existing account at apply time, which would otherwise read
  as "everyone was active"), plus the exemption table and a permanent `topup` exemption.
  **The job remains UNSCHEDULED.** A point-in-time PRE-ARM count returning `0` is **not** a
  sufficient re-arm condition — the query in that migration's header only reads a growing
  eligible set, and evaluated forward against the current population it returns 0 on 2026-09-06,
  1 on 09-07, and 12 on 09-08. Anyone arming on a `0` reading would still lose real accounts
  within two days. A forward projection over the whole arming window is required, not a single
  reading, and the correct criterion for that projection is unsettled, and it is the owner's call; both jobs stay unscheduled until it is decided.
- **Account enumeration on the login path (decided 2026-08-11)**: `login()` now maps
  GoTrue error codes to messages that match the real cause, instead of answering every failure
  with one "wrong password" string (`describeSignInError`, `src/data/accountRepository.supabase.ts`).
  A distinct message is only safe for a code that fires **regardless of whether the address has an
  account** — otherwise the message itself answers "does this email have an account here?" for
  anyone who asks, with no password needed. `invalid_credentials` stays deliberately ambiguous for
  exactly this reason (upstream `supabase/auth internal/api/token.go` returns it byte-identically
  for "no such user" and "wrong password"). Two codes were therefore **excluded**, both of which
  only ever fire once GoTrue has already found the user:
  - `email_not_confirmed` — **deleted, not merely left unmapped**. Measured against the live
    project 2026-08-11: `mailer_autoconfirm: true`, unconfirmed users **0**, banned users **0**.
    Every signup is auto-confirmed, so the code is unreachable today, and the message it would
    have shown pointed the player at a confirmation link that cannot be delivered anyway (no
    custom SMTP — next entry). Left in the table it would arm itself the day autoconfirm is
    turned off, which is the same day SMTP gets configured.
  - `user_banned` — no user is banned today; the generic non-leaking message is kept and no
    distinct one was added.

  Both fall through to the same "unexpected error" default as an unknown code, so an outsider
  cannot separate them from any other failure. Pinned by `#93 describeSignInError` in
  `src/data/accountRepository.supabase.test.ts`: re-adding either code to `SIGN_IN_ERROR_MESSAGES`
  turns that test red. **Not closed by this change**: `register()` still answers a taken address
  with 'อีเมลนี้ถูกใช้สมัครไปแล้ว' and a free one with a different outcome — the same oracle on the
  signup path. It is untouched here and is separate work, not a regression from this commit.

- **No custom SMTP — all email-based account recovery is blocked (2026-08-11)**: the project's
  `smtp_host` is null, so Supabase's built-in mailer refuses every address not on the project team
  and caps sends at 2 per hour **project-wide**. A password-recovery form was written
  and **deliberately not shipped** on that finding: with that mailer an existing address hits the
  mailer's 400 and renders a red error, while a non-existent address returns 200 and renders the
  "if an account exists we sent a link" notice — two visibly different outcomes, no password
  required, and the "no account" branch consumes no email budget, so it repeats without limit.
  That is a 100%-reliable account-existence oracle, strictly worse than the login path it was
  meant to complement. Its rate-limit message also blamed the player for a project-wide budget
  any stranger can exhaust. The recovery route stays out of the product until a real mailer
  exists; until then `SIGN_IN_FAILED_MESSAGE` states plainly that no password reset exists rather
  than pointing at a button that is not on screen.
- **CAPTCHA (Cloudflare Turnstile)**: client-side widget shipped (`AuthModal.tsx`, `VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`).
  Supabase's Dashboard toggle (Authentication → Settings → Attack Protection) is project-wide
  across all `signUp`/`signInWithPassword`/`signInAnonymously` calls, not scoped per method —
  **enabled server-side** (`security_captcha_enabled: true`). Verified 2026-08-10 over HTTP
  against the real anon key (not a live browser): login succeeded, RLS confined reads to the
  caller's own rows, and a direct `PATCH` of the server-owned columns was refused with `42501`.

## Supply-Chain / CI

- Third-party GitHub Actions are pinned to full commit SHAs, not floating version tags
  (see any `.github/workflows/*.yml`).
- Secret scanning: [`gitleaks`](.github/workflows/security-scan.yml) runs on every push/PR and
  daily via the free CLI directly (not the paid Action, which requires a license for org repos).
- Dependency vulnerabilities: `npm audit --audit-level=high` runs daily and on every push.
- GitHub Dependabot alerts and security updates are enabled on this repo.
