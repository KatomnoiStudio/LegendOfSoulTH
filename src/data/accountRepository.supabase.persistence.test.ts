  ── 2026-08-10 audit, F1/F2/F3 — the save/load path's data-integrity guards ────────────────

  F1: `savePlayer` read `friends` back in `loadPlayer` but never wrote it. The table and its RLS
      write policy have existed since 0001_init.sql:113 — only the client call was missing. The
      add-friend toast said "added" (savePlayer really did return true) and the friend was gone
      on the next load, with nothing tying the two events together.

  F2: the highest-leverage guard in the whole set — assert that EVERY field of `Player` is
      accounted for by exactly one owner (savePlayer's own writes, a server-owned RPC, a
      read-only identity field, or a NAMED known gap). A field nobody owns is a field that
      silently does not persist, which is how F1 happened at all and how the dormant
      dungeon-EXP and `progress.energy` traps are still sitting there today.

  F3: `loadPlayer` fires 8 queries in parallel and used to inspect only the first one's error.
      supabase-js resolves errors as `{ data, error }` and never throws, so a failed query
      degraded into an empty array — and the very next `savePlayer` wrote that emptiness back
      over the real rows.

  guess, on the failure path this game hits most, while `normalizeError.ts:146-152` sat there
  with code/details/hint extraction and was handed nothing.

  Reporting moved to where the error is still alive. These tests are the teeth: each fails

    added, which is exactly how the first three got there.

      Segment between one `return false` and the previous one, rather than a fixed lookback of
      N lines. The first version looked back 3 lines and was reproduced false-positiving: give
      any context object a second key, Prettier wraps the call across four lines, and the
      window spans only the object's tail — never reaching `reportError(`. The test would have
      failed CI against correct code, and the next author would have had to work out why.

      Segmenting is formatting-independent by construction. It can only ever under-report (a
      report belonging to an earlier branch covering a later bare return), never over-report,
      which is the right direction for a guard that gates a build.
