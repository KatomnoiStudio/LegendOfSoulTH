/**
 * The sprite compiler this domain never had — measurements in `docs/SPRITE-CONFORMANCE.md`.
 *
 * Every number in that conformance record came from a person deciding to measure. Asset defects
 * are silent by nature: a frame on the wrong canvas renders fine and is merely 81.5% too big, a
 * turn set numbered wrong faces the character the wrong way with no error, and a 51 px foot drift
 * makes the character bob. None of it throws. This file asserts the four invariants that ARE
 * computable from the shipped files alone, so those defects become CI failures instead of prose.
 *
 *   1. CANVAS PER PREFIX      every frame sharing one prefix shares one canvas size
 *   2. PATHS AND COUNTS       every path the code pins resolves, and the pinned count is what ships
 *   3. DIRECTION ORDER        the turn set is addressed by NUMBER, the walk set by NAME
 *   4. ANCHOR TOLERANCE       foot-line drift inside the band for the animation kind
 *   5. DERIVED WORLD SIZE     every drawn family is calibrated, and one character is one height
 *
 * `docs/SPRITE-DESIGN-LOCK.md` is the owner-locked standard; `docs/SPRITE-CONFORMANCE.md` is what
 * this repo measures against it. Both are prerequisites for editing anything below.
