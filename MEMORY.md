> **Repository**: `KatomnoiStudio/LegendOfSoulTH`
> **Default Branch**: `master`
> **Last Updated**: 2026-08-09T20:15:00+07:00 by `Claude Code` — design-fork handoff answered and implemented: currency ledger archive built on the live Postgres backend, gacha's determinism criterion rewritten to statistical testing + dead client module deleted, PvP P12 private-room ruled scope drift not an interim phase (item 179).
> **Last Updated (prior)**: 2026-08-10T03:40:00+07:00 by `Claude Code` — full doc-vs-code fidelity audit: 63 agents, 147 stale doc claims corrected across AGENTS.md/AGENT_BLUEPRINT.md/28 system contracts/`.agents/rules/`/MASTER_BLUEPRINT/TASKS/MEMORY, README.md rewritten for its real (agent/dev) audience, 3 real design forks handed off for a human decision (item 178).
> **Last Updated (prior)**: 2026-08-10T01:15:00+07:00 by `Claude Code` — v0.15.2: closed the PvP gate leak found by rot-canary over v0.15.1 (item 177). Gacha is live and verified; PvP stays gated until its Edge Function is deployed.
> **Last Updated (prior)**: 2026-08-10T00:30:00+07:00 by `Claude Code` — v0.15.1: gated the PvP button behind its undeployed backend after v0.15.0 shipped it broken to live; applied and verified the gacha migration in production (item 176).
> **Last Updated (prior)**: 2026-08-09T23:10:00+07:00 by `Claude Code` — **v0.14.1 released** — shipped the OAuth redirect + PKCE fix to live (item 175). Messenger/webview hypothesis ruled out by a real-device test.
> **Last Updated (prior)**: 2026-08-09T22:05:00+07:00 by `Claude Code` — OAuth redirect + PKCE fix (item 175): Google login was redirecting to the org root instead of the app, stranding the session JWT in the address bar. Pushed direct to master per Ring 0.
> **Last Updated (prior)**: 2026-08-09T21:30:00+07:00 by `Codex` — P12 private authoritative PvP prototype (#21); see item 173.
> **Last Updated (prior)**: 2026-08-09T14:35:59+07:00 by `Codex` — PR #96 CoalBoard review fixes for P12 authority; see item 174.

> _History below is newest-first. Several concurrent agents each appended their own `Last Updated` line, so this block had drifted out of chronological order and carried four differently-labelled "latest" entries; re-sorted and relabelled 2026-08-09 while resolving the PR #84 merge. One label rule: the newest line is `Last Updated`, every older one is `Last Updated (prior)`._

> **Last Updated (prior)**: 2026-08-09T18:20:00+07:00 by `Codex` — Production trust-boundary follow-up for consolidated PR #77/#78; see items 168–169.
> **Last Updated (prior)**: 2026-08-09T11:30:00+07:00 by `Cursor Agent` — P11 Chapter 1 PvE expansion (v0.14.0): per-stage rewards, locked energy, mini-boss trial-08, difficulty/duration metadata.
> **Last Updated (prior)**: 2026-08-09T03:15:00+07:00 by `Cursor Agent` — P10 Production Batch 01 (5 archetypes, v0.13.0): per-hero kits/combos, 3 new roster heroes, summon/CC runtime, gacha+star skeleton; see `docs/hero-production/PRODUCTION_BATCH_01.md`.
> **Last Updated (prior)**: 2026-08-09T02:50:00+07:00 by `Cursor Agent` — branch hygiene pass: pruned merged local `cursor/*-b471` branches; documented remote WIP branch ledger (item 159).
> **Last Updated (prior)**: 2026-08-09T02:10:00+07:00 by `Claude Code` — Hero Kit #12/DF20: CoalBoard opinion-lane (ask CB, 4 blind seats) fixed the Lv11+ EXP formula regression and the Ultimate damage-scale outlier; `ffb741c`. TASKS.md row DF20 stays 90% (Ring 0 instruction) pending playtest graduation.
> **Last Updated (prior)**: 2026-08-09T00:25:00+07:00 by `Cursor Agent` — v0.12.5 fix: ปุ่มต่อสู้แสดงหน้าเลือกด่าน (pending-reward recovery ไม่ปิด overlay + StageSelect z-index/DOM order).
> **Last Updated (prior)**: 2026-08-08T20:58:00+07:00 by `Claude Code` — Hero Kit #12/DF20: wired the blueprint's locked `castDelayMs` (S2 250 / S3 320 / Ult 480) into `attacks.ts`; re-derived `SkillSystem.test.ts` Done-criterion 4's phase checkpoints since castDelay composes as an additive phase before startup, not folded in. `6a92982`/PR #90.
> **RULES_VERSION last synced: 30** (2026-08-10, Operator: HetCreep, Agent: Claude Code (belt-end main) — worker-DONE verified by main on the commit stream + completion-challenge right; quota-death = transient, re-dispatch same sid self-contained, never main-fallback; cwd hygiene duty incl. empty-folder removal, 5-main-turn sweep limit, binds every ring; see items 183)
> **(prior) RULES_VERSION last synced: 29** (2026-08-10, Operator: HetCreep, Agent: Claude Code (belt-end main) — queue-cleanup hard limit: completed swept at next queue touch, ceiling 2, reaching 3 = the violation; cleanup is MAIN's own duty; DONE requires ship-verification — gate named + landing checked, code-written is not done; set after the owner caught exactly 3 lingering)
> **(prior) RULES_VERSION last synced: 28** (local `master`, 2026-08-09, Operator: HetCreep, Agent: Claude Code (belt-end main) — 27: rule 23 belt-system-law installed + rules 16/18 amended (item 180) · 28: the ADDRESSING rule (a law binds only the seat it addresses; Layer 1 = belt end alone, worker duties = every worker seat any ring, Layer 2 intake = Ring-1) + Ring-1 duty ends at PR submission, sole prohibition = merging even with permission; see item 181)
> **(prior) RULES_VERSION last synced: 26** (local `master`, this session) — bumped 17→18 (multi-dev task queue law) →19 (Agent Blueprint execution-order rule) →20 (Ring 0 traffic control law) →21 (claim protocol made Ring-0-locked) →22 (break-glass claim fallback for repo-admin devs) →23 (security doc sync law, from a `/gold-standard` AUDIT) →24 (tasks/memory parity law, HetCreep asked directly after catching TASKS.md drift twice) →25 (working-directory concurrency lock law, added after Claude/Antigravity live collision) within this same session. **Unrelated note carried forward, now corrected**: an earlier version of this line read "19" citing a pending fork PR #59 (Cursor Agent, cloud) as not yet merged. That was wrong, not just unconfirmed — PR #59 **is** merged (`ce4980d`, a confirmed ancestor of `origin/master`; see item 142, the Stage/Adventure System Dogfood second pass). This session's 17→18→19→20→21→22→23→24→25 RULES_VERSION chain was independent of PR #59 either way, so no renumbering is needed.

> **2026-08-06 overhaul**: this file had grown to 65+ interleaved, verbose items (two colliding numbering
> tracks from concurrent sessions/forks) and was getting expensive to read every session. Compressed to
> essentials per HetCreep's explicit request. **Full narrative detail for anything below now lives in
> `git log`/`git show <sha>` — commit messages this session are detailed and are the source of truth for
> "why," not this file.** Keep future entries to 1-3 lines; link a commit SHA instead of re-narrating it.
>
> **2026-08-08 second surgery** (HetCreep's explicit request): Current Status was capped hard (~40 bullets → 15) — anything fully resolved/superseded got cut, not narrated (it's already in the Timeline or in `git log`). Every Timeline item (1-101, plus 102-106 for facts that had only ever lived in Current Status) was re-compressed to 1-3 sentences; nothing was renumbered, merged, or silently dropped.

## 👤 Identity & System Context

- **Owner**: `HetCreep`
- **Project**: Legend of Soul TH (repo slug `LegendOfSoulTH`) — **Stage-based 2.5D Hero Collection Action RPG** · **Universe of Legends** (รามเกียรติ์ = Chapter/Series แรกได้ ไม่ใช่เพดาน IP) · 2D HD sprites · PvE-first → Ranked PvP 1v1 ทีหลัง. Stack: React 19 + TypeScript (strict) + Vite 8 + Three.js/R3F (lobby), Oxlint. Auth/accounts are real Supabase (server-side, item 41) — the localStorage backend (`accountRepository.ts`) stays in the tree as an untouched fallback seam, not the active one. World Chat server authority is implemented but awaits migration apply (item 158).
- **Product baseline**: [`docs/MASTER_BLUEPRINT_v3.0.md`](docs/MASTER_BLUEPRINT_v3.0.md) (ADOPTED, HetCreep Ring 0, 2026-08-07 — **the only blueprint file now**, v1.0 deleted/consolidated) · [`docs/BLUEPRINT_V3_MIGRATION_AUDIT.md`](docs/BLUEPRINT_V3_MIGRATION_AUDIT.md) · gap register [`docs/BLUEPRINT_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`](docs/BLUEPRINT_GAP_ANALYSIS.md) (historical, v1.0-era) · law `.agents/rules/master-blueprint-law.md`
- **Live**: https://katomnoistudio.github.io/LegendOfSoulTH/

## 🎯 Current Status

- **Repo**: upstream `master` @ `d45552b` · **v0.14.0** · merged this session: PR #90 (castDelayMs), #91 (memory), #95 (P12 ranked power normalization), #84 (branch hygiene). `cursor/*-b471` agent branches pruned locally after merge (item 159).
- **Version**: **0.15.2** on live — v0.14.0 was P11 Chapter 1 PvE expansion; 0.14.1 was the OAuth redirect + PKCE fix (item 175, not item 172 as this line previously misattributed — item 172 is the Lobby/Gacha integration entry); 0.15.1 gated the undeployed PvP button and applied the gacha migration live, and 0.15.2 closed the PvP gate leak found by rot-canary (items 176-177). Deploy gate: bump BOTH `GAME_INFO.version` and `package.json` in the same PR — `gameInfo.test.ts` pins them equal and bumping only one turns CI red.
- **Org/Live**: `KatomnoiStudio` — https://katomnoistudio.github.io/LegendOfSoulTH/
- **Backend**: Supabase Auth+Postgres live, wired via `useAuth.ts` (item 41/87). `accountRepository.ts` (localStorage) stays as a dormant fallback seam only.
- **Master Blueprint v3.0**: P0–P3 DONE · §3.6/§3.7 LOCKED · mobile combat UI done (§3.3) · P4 LANDED (item 109) · P5 dungeon slice + reward pipeline LANDED (items 111-112) · P8 per-hero progression LANDED (item 119, numerics still NON-PRODUCTION) · Basic Attack Lunge Distance closed (item 124).
- **Battle (current)**: realtime 2.5D · ต่อสู้/เริ่มผจญภัย → StageSelect → BattleScene (Ch.1 10 stages, P11 enriched). **Hero Batch 01**: monkey-king (Fighter), pig-warrior (Heavy), celestial-archer (Ranged), nezha-warden (Control), sand-sage (Summoner) — 3 ตัวใหม่ placeholder sprites (`docs/hero-production/PRODUCTION_BATCH_01.md`). pilgrim-monk → Batch 02.
- **P11**: `stageRewardConfig.ts` per-stage tables + first-clear; energy locked 120/60/10/boss×2 + gem refill skeleton; `trial-08` mini-boss; all Ch.1 stages have `difficultyMultiplier` + `targetDurationMs`.
- **P8 balance lock** (Ring 0, 2026-08-09): DF20 ownership is Codex on PR #83 · caps + playtest baseline in `progressionConfig.ts`/`rewardConfig.ts` · Lv11+ EXP uses the monotonic continuation `10n²+10n+100` · Ultimate is 4×1.1 = 4.4x ATK total · stage 1 tutorial-easy (2 waves, HP×0.7, 2500ms interval) · failure `partial` = heroExp by progress only · `nonProductionBalance` banner stays · talent/awakening UI hidden (`showTalentAwakeningUi: false`). **PR #90**: S2/S3/Ultimate's blueprint-locked `castDelayMs` (250/320/480) now wired into `attacks.ts`, composing as an additive phase before startup.
- **DF20 open follow-ups (flagged, decided 2026-08-08)**: S2 (`monkey-staff-thrust`)/S3 (`monkey-staff-sweep`) still reuse the basic combo's own `animationId` ('attack-2'/'attack-3') — a CoalBoard "feeling"-seat finding that they read as "spend a cooldown to punch slightly harder with the same animation" rather than a distinct kit identity, unlike S1/Ultimate. HetCreep's call when asked directly: **defer** — wait for real hero animation/sprites before deciding S2/S3 kit identity, don't build against placeholder art. Same precedent as item #13's sprite-flip deferral. Not implemented; no code change from this finding.
- **Still open**: measured mobile playtest/TTK dataset for S2/S3/basic-finisher magnitude and the full playtest round required before dropping the NON-PRODUCTION banner. Do not infer final literals from the current test dungeon alone.
- **Gold-standard**: current figure is item 99's **77%** (12-dim AUDIT+FILL+ADOPT). An earlier ~84% figure merged in via PR #25 is SUPERSEDED — different scoring pass/day, don't average or reconcile.
- **UI/UX gold-standard backlog**: `.agents/rules/gold-standard-baseline.md` — MUST-HAVEs closed, EXCELLENCE-tier gaps (3D char-select keyboard path, tab-strip `aria-controls`, `AuthModal` live-validation, breakpoint tokens, some reduced-motion) tracked there, not scaffolded.
- **Security posture**: real Supabase/RLS/RPC trust boundary (`SECURITY.md` corrected item 99). CodeQL + Dependabot + Secret Scanning + Gitleaks + NPM Audit + branch protection + SHA-pinning all on; `secret_scanning_validity_checks` needs manual toggle (Settings → Code security). **2026-08-08 (items 145-148)**: economy/RLS integrity fixes (unbounded-currency-mint RPC gap, `profiles.gold/gem` column-write bypass, `owned_characters` progression-save bug, coupon double-redemption race, RPC rate limiting, `findPlayerByUid` lookup RPC, reward idempotency) all shipped as `0009`-`0013` **and VERIFIED LIVE on production** (item 148) — closes a standing blocker open for most of this session. Two real bugs surfaced and were fixed during the live apply: a pre-existing duplicate-row set on 2 dev/test accounts (not real players) that blocked 0013's unique index, and a `grant_item` function-overload collision (old 3-arg + new 4-arg coexisting) since fixed live. Migration deploy is still a manual Supabase-Dashboard-SQL-editor step — no automated pipeline exists yet.
- **Repo access**: `HetCreep` / `nustanakritwithai` / `DemoGODRTX` all `admin:true`. `kaoshock123` git-author = `DemoGODRTX` account (confirmed).
- **CharacterPreview sprites**: re-cropped to 396x376 (was 640x512), `SPRITE_ZOOM` now `1` (was `1.31`) — item 122.
- **Branch protection — open, HetCreep's call**: required check + conversation-resolution + no force-push are ON (item 80), but `enforce_admins` is still `false` — all 3 admins can still push straight to `master` (also flagged in item 99's audit).
- **CI/Deploy**: web deploys only when `GAME_INFO.version` changes (cheap `gate` job decides first); manual release via `workflow_dispatch` — see README "การปล่อยเว็บ".
- **Player accounts/currency/items/friends/chat**: Supabase-backed live path. World Chat server-authority code/migration is implemented (`world_chat_messages` + RLS/RPC/Realtime) but is not production-live until the new migration is applied.
- **Multi-dev governance**: `TASKS.md` is the Ring-0-locked claim ledger for 3+ concurrent devs; Ring 1 never pushes straight to `master` (`ring0-traffic-control-law.md`) — branch+PR or hand off to Ring 0 directly.

## 🧠 Lessons & Conventions (`[[tag]]`)

- **`[[browser-pane-not-compositing]]`** — this environment's Browser pane sometimes doesn't render/composite frames (canvas stuck at default size, `screenshot` errors "not compositing"). When it happens, verify via code review + typecheck/build + DOM/layout inspection instead of visual screenshots, and say so honestly rather than claiming untested visuals worked.
- **`[[css-fix-overcorrection]]`** — resizing/rescaling a themed frame (proportional CSS changes) without also checking what's positioned _inside_ it against the same math causes overflow/misalignment. Always recompute inner-element positions by the same scale factor, not just the outer box.
- **`[[percent-maxheight-grid-indeterminate]]`** — a percentage `max-height` on a grid/flex item whose container sizes to content (`display:grid; place-items:center`) never resolves (circular sizing). Use `dvh`/viewport units or an explicit container size instead.
- **`[[test-existence-not-authenticity]]`** — a test file testing a code path proves the code was once exercised, not that it's reachable in production today. Always trace real callers/entry points before trusting "it has tests" as evidence of aliveness.
- **`[[shared-hook-refuted-by-divergent-semantics]]`** — a "let's extract one shared hook/component" instinct across superficially-similar systems (UI modals, input handling) should be checked against real behavioral divergence first; ask-CB has independently refuted this proposal twice this project (UI/HUD systems, then input systems) because the systems' downstream semantics genuinely differed.
- **`[[verify-before-assuming-regression]]`** — a reverted-looking diff from a concurrent push/merge can be a legitimate supersession (e.g. an asset that was deleted got re-added with new content), not a regression. Check the CURRENT state of the file/asset before "fixing" it back.
- **New-systems law**: any system a session builds, or discovers another dev/session merged, that's genuinely new (not a fix/content-addition to an existing system) gets a multi-perspective review pass before being considered done — **Claude Code sessions**: CoalBoard's "ask CB" 4-seat opinion lane; **any other agent** (e.g. Cursor Agent, which doesn't have that tool): get explicit HetCreep sign-off directly before marking it done, don't skip the check silently just because the specific tool isn't available. Ring-0-scoped instruction text lives in gitignored `MEMORY.local.md`; the practice itself is documented here since it governs project history.
- **Pre-push sync law**: `.agents/rules/pre-push-sync-law.md` — `git fetch` + check ahead/behind, merge any incoming commits, re-run full verify, only then push. Binding on every machine, every push.
- **`[[fork-pr-not-delivery]]`** — fork PR = staging branch holder only. Delivery = upstream PR URL on `KatomnoiStudio/LegendOfSoulTH`, or report **BLOCKED** + compare link. Never say "ส่งงานแล้ว" from fork PR alone (`.agents/rules/upstream-submission-workflow.md` §0, RULES_VERSION 19).
- **Personal-scope law**: `.agents/rules/personal-scope-law.md` — personal/off-project content never goes in this file (mandatory reading has a token cost every future session pays); use gitignored `MEMORY.local.md`.
- **Commit-granularity law**: `.agents/rules/commit-granularity-law.md` — one completed task = one commit.
- **PowerShell 5.1 has no `` `u{XXXX} `` unicode escape** — silently inserts literal text instead of erroring. Use `[char]0x201C` or type the character directly; always verify inserted content with Read afterward.
- **`[[git-bash-msys-pathconv]]`** — Git Bash's MSYS path-conversion mangles a raw base64/key string passed as a CLI arg if it happens to start with `/` (e.g. `/9Gksc3Ti...` → `C:/Program Files/Git/9Gksc3Ti...`), producing cryptic downstream errors (e.g. "bad public key size" from an encryption lib) with no hint the argument itself was corrupted. Prefix the command with `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` on this machine whenever passing a raw base64/key string as a bash argument to `node`/similar.
- **`[[org-level-secret-not-secrets-repo]]`** — for centralizing a secret needed by more than one repo in an org, use an **org-level GitHub Actions secret with `visibility:"selected"`** scoped to the repos that need it. A "dedicated private secrets repo" doesn't actually work: a consuming repo needs a PAT to read another repo's secrets, and that PAT itself becomes a secret needing the same protection (circular, no real isolation gained).
- **`[[parallel-backend-fix-scope]]`** — `useAuth.ts`/`accountRepository.supabase.ts` (live) and `accountRepository.ts` (localStorage, dormant fallback) are deliberately parallel implementations; only one is imported by `useAuth.ts` at a time. Whenever one gets modified, grep for the other before assuming a fix/removal applies there too — "fix X" almost always means "fix X in whichever backend `useAuth.ts` currently imports," not both.
- **A module that throws synchronously at import/eval time is a single point of total-app failure `ErrorBoundary` can never catch** (the throw happens before React mounts) — any such module (env-var-gated clients like `supabaseClient.ts` are the common case) should be behind a dynamic `import()` with a `.catch()` fallback, not a static top-level `import`.
